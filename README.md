# reduce_resize_csv
if you need a half size (or quarter etc) and reduced content csv for testing


Sometimes you need to work on a .csv file but the file is very large (e.g. 1.6 gigs) and is cumbersome for some tasks where you do not need the whole file.

With this tool you can make smaller versions of the .csv file.

a python script version and a python notebook version are both available

the python script can be run in a terminal and will ask for file name and how many half-reductions you want
